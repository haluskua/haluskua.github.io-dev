        <h1>Identity, Values and strength Exploration</h1>

                <h4 class="sub-title">1. Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
                <img src="../img/hausman.jpg" class="print-scr" alt="rectangle shape with lines and diagram">
                <p class="para-1"><b>Ethical decision:</b> I have come to reflect that an ethical decision is relative to the basis of the individuals culture, tradition, religion and the social and economical environment such as oganizational policies etc. These basis moulds one's belief and values and identity. We all live in a world that is full of people with different ethics and outlook on life. Therefore it is not easy to be ethical and be a 1000% right. <br>
                About 15 year ago I was meant to go back to my homeland Papua New Guinea(PNG) and get married through our customary law but I chose not to as I was here in NZ and had other important commitments. Even though I knew I did the right thing, I know that not everyone understood me and probably still wont. But I felt it was the right thing to do. <br><br>
                <b>Cultural influence: </b>Growing up at in PNG has embedded into my bones my values and Identity. Yet having to intergrate while living in NZ has also allowed me to explore and appreciate both cultures and build stronger values. My identity as a man from PNG will always be my conscience. <br>

            <div class="two-columns">
              <h4 class="sub-title">2. Using the evidence gathered describe you strentgh and limitations.</h4>
              <img src="../img/push.jpg" class="print-scr2" alt="girl climbing out of hole">
              <br><br>
              <p class="para-1"><b>Strengths:</b> I have been told that I am honest and loyal by many of my friends. Creativity is something I enjoy most and I consider myself friendly and great people person. <br>
              </p>
              <p class="para-1"><b>Weaknesses:</b> On the flip side there are limitations to my strengths such as staying driven. I mean sometimes I am driven or passionate about something and then I do another something and then another and then I eventually come back to the begining and by then I am burnt out. Not taking care of myself such as personal grooming etc <i>(I have been told that by a good friend)</i> <br>
              </p>
              <p class="para-1"><b>Work experience with others:</b> When I was elected as President of the PNG community here in Wellington last year, I had to organize all member from all ages young and old. During one of our festive celebrations, there was a dispute over how much funds should be allocated toward the entertainment. So I drew up a quick budget plan with our treasure and vice-president of the group and emailed everone a copy a day later. Upon the next meeting, everyone came together and more or less felt less fired up because of the open budget plan. If I could try another technique now, it would be to get everone to vote because that could have saved a whole lot of work and time and effort on my side. <i></i> <br>
