            <h2># Final Reflections - Sprint One </2>
            
            In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:
            
            <h4>### What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h4>
            
            The learning strategy is great. I feel like I was at fault for NOT reading all the instructions thoroughly before starting. So I found myself going back and fort and wasting time because I got a bit lost and made a mistake in cloning the DEV repository into my local machine instead of forking it into my repository first.
            
            <h4>### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? </h4>
            
            I am learning most of the challenges but I feell quite confident now than before.
            
            
            <h4>### Which parts of the work did you enjoy?</h4>
            The git pull and push part and the logic behind forking another repository and asking them to merge to the original. 
            
            
            <h4>### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?</h4>
            
            Apart from following each step carefully, I tripped myself over the ko-wai-koi repository which I made a few retarted commits ( but learnt my mistake)
            
            <h4>### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?</h4>
            
            voice message - "don't be clumsy and rush, take your time it will be less messier and more appreciative"  Oh yeah,, I believe that. 
            
            I hope to listen to voice in the next sprint.

            <h4>#Organizing myself </h4>
            * Until I get myself a new Laptop, I can't do much with software download. Currently using my old laptop which can only run on 
            AC current from a charger.  ** I will start my 9 hour prep programming challenge.<br><br>

            //////////////////////////////<br>
            ----//--Post-virtual-Orientation--//---<br><br>

            OKAY, I do feel a overwhelmed with just the prepping it took before the course start date 15th/04/2019. I appreciated the video 
            conference through 'Zoom' as I got to meet and greet the rest of the class. I am anxious and a bit scared but am looking forward to the 
            challenge. 

            I agree and certainly like the idea or learning system by devAc where we are going to be thought the skills of how to how to resource 
            knowledge or simply learn. *cool. A rather different or a more evolved system of education, which I believe is suitable for 
            this particular field: 

            Lastly but more like the elephant in the room, it feels like there is so much information/links prepping materials to go through before 
            to synch or have a workflow set up. Then again I just started late and head is still in clouds so allguds.

            P.S - I hope I won't have to write so much again as if I am complaining. :) <br><br>

            ----//--Getting to know git workflow--//---<br>

            <h4>#How does git work?</h4> 

            -With Git, each project has its own repository - a collection of all the versions of the project along with some special information - What order the changes occurred; A description of each change; who was responsible for each change etc.
            
            git pull: If you’re working on your local computer and want the most up-to-date version of your repository to work with, you “pull” the changes down from GitHub with this command. This is useful when you are working on the same repository as someone else, or on different computers.
            
            <h3>In your reflection answer the questions:</h3>

            <h4>#What is a GitHub work flow?</h4>
            - is a branch based system that supports projects and collaboration where deployment is monitored

            <H4>#What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</H4>
            - Trying to find a pattern in using the git flow system and stick to it. If stuck I would got to google first.
            #Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
            - Maybe - Seek advice from fellow Collegues<br><br>

            ----//--Track and Commit--//---<br>

           <H4> #How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</H4>
            - Stage is when a project or changes have been compiled or added but yet to be approved 
            and commit is after it has been approved and given a message to be pacakaged and added to the new stage/status
            
            And a I learned that a good format setup in writing a commit mesage is appreciated. It depends on different groups that use a certain style<br><br>

            ----//--Version Control and git Primer--//---

            <h4>#Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</h4>
            - git is a software that you can download to your computer and github is the hub that you can sign up to. 
            
            <h4>#Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h4>
            - git is the tool that links and administers your local dev environment to the remote serve (github) where code is compared and     organised to avoid overwrites
            
            <h4>#Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?</h4>
            -Yes
            Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

            Yes<br><br>

            ----//--Branch, Pull, Merg--//---

            <h4>#What is the Master</h4>

            The head of the branch or workflow which Should be the final stage that can be packaged.

            <h4>#why create a branch?</h4>

            We create a branch to allow for freedom in working seperately from the master branch.

            <h4># Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</h4>

            Concept is very logical, and awesome, its just about how to use the right commands at the right time.<br><br>

            //////////////////////////////

            ----//--Command Line Primer--//---

            <!-- Copy the answers you wrote in your temporary file earlier, under the sections below -->

           <h4> ### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h4>

            * Command line allowed me to manipulate files with only commands instead of the use of a mouse and limits window jumping etc.

            <h4>### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h4>

            * No! I guess I did kind of rush a bit but I realise it is important and I am going to follow it soon.

            <h4>### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</h4>
            * cd = to get to or locate a directory and enter its realm<br>
            * ls = lists all items within the directory<br>
            * mkdir = make a directory - followed by a name for the directory after a space<br>
            * cd.. = brings you up/back in the navigation tree<br>
            * rm -rf = removes a directory  

            <h4>### Did you learn anything unexpected?</h4>

            { I wonder if the command 'rm -rf' removes a single file as well - I believe it does?)
            - the 'rm -rf command became popular after the Sprint 1 workshp video
            which got me thinking: Towards the end of the video, the new branch was merged in the remote (on github) 
            mmmmm?

            * Most of the stuff here are new. The thing that is unexpected is that we it a different system of working --

            <h4>#What is Master?</h4>
            -is the final or the top branch that all cmmits merge into. It is contains the approved and deployed development code.
            <h4>#Why create a Branch?</h4>
            - Branch are created to avoid allow a seperate development environment to be commited back into the master later on/
            <h4>#Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?</h4>
            -mmm yes and no. It is respective to experience<br>

            <h4># Track and Commit Primer!</h4>

            <!-- Copy your reflection answer into this file --> 

            <h4>### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend? </h4> 

            Stage is the state before the commit. Usually you have made some changes and are happy to move to the next stage. 
            Commit is when you join it to the original path of the whole project. You are actully locking the connenction - usually with a message.


            <h2># GitHub Fork & Clone</h2>

            <!-- Answer the following questions -->

            <h4>### What are some examples of when you would fork?</h4>
            I would fork a project from the remote of another github owner so that I could then clone that from my repository into my local directory on my laptop where the changes there can be then merge to the owners repo after a pull and then merge request.


            <h4>### Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.</h4>

            I forked the main repository into my repository. Then cloned that repository from my repository into my local directory on my computer, to make changes.


            <h4>### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h4>

            Yes, when I realised that the changes i made on that repository on my local computer is not yet final until the owner of the main repository accepts a pull and merge request by me.

            <h2># Setup Repo & Create Blog</h2>

            <h4>### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h4>

            I wouldn't say frustrated, but more intrigued.

            <h4>### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</h4>

            I had a rough idea of how websites were created but certainly believe there are mor

            <h3># Thinking like a programmer</h3>

            <h4>### Describe the process for solving problems</h4>

            If I trip or get into a problem, I will go to google first for direction. Then maybe get a second opinion later from a friend after solution.

            <h4>### Will you follow that process? How?</h4>
            I like going to google and is always the first place. 

            <h4>### What did you learn about flipped </h4>classroom?

            <h4># Introduce yourself</h4>
            Hi all, can take this chance to introduce myself. My name is Omphalus Kua. I come from a small town in the heart of Papua New Guinea known as Chimbu. I live Wellington. I am a single father and I am a little shy and clumsy/awkward but I am a good team player. Not the brightest but I am a good listener. I am attending EDA to become good at Javascript/programming. Thanks and hope to meet you guys.

            <h4>### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</h4>

            It was okay. I didn't feel too comfortable in writing too much about myself.

            <h4>### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? </h4>
            Yes I was self conscious but I don't know about ego coz I am here to learn.
