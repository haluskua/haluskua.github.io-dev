              <p>My long term goal is to one day become a fullstack developer and build web and mobile applications with attention to UI/UX and work for a firm. I am fascinated with the Javascrip programming language and in software development in general.</p>

              <p><b>Formulating Learning Plan:</b> <br><br>I will also need to manage my time so that I will maintain a consistent work ethic towards my study. I also want to be able to communicate well with collegues to help me out when I get stuck. This means I can use channels like 'Slack' emails or one on one meetings with someone from the class. Also being a good listener and contributor can help me gather useful information from people around me.<br><br>
              I would like to become more confident in talking to people about anything but more importantly, I want to be less shy and get right amongst everone and make mistakes and learn from it. My strength is my eagerness to learn but my weakness is my slightly shy attitude but I am working really hard to break this by opening up to people more and more.<br><br>
              I will manage my workload by making sure I come in to campus more often during the day and weekends to put in the hours towards my learning. That way I am able to organize for meet ups or help from fascilitators or collegues. I could use the chat forums to get help but probably the biggest one is find a buddy to work together on projects etc. I hope and expect the fascilitators to be direct and helpful and honest. Not everyday is a good day.  </p>
