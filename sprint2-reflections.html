                <h2># Final Reflections - Sprint Two </h2>
                
                <h3>In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions:</h3>
                
                <h4>### How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies from this sprint?</h4>
                I think I am felling okay with the last two sprints.
                
                
                
                <h4>### Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?</h4>
                The part where I was challenged to link html and css to build webapag.
                
                
                
                <h4>### Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?
                The par of the sprint where I have what seems like a lot of reseach topics to go though</h4>
                
                
                
                <h4>### How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you? </h4>
                Well my critical voice is always telling me to be extra careful and not to rush into finishing a project. And even now he is telling me that I am still going though the sprints not very thorough enough.
                
                
                
                <h4>### If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say? </h4>
                I would tell him that a website really does take a lot of effort and thinking because it is all about the user experience and what they have to use. To make a website you can you Html and Css with a bit of javascript to make a good website. But to make it very user friendly requries a lot more planning and thinking for layout structure with respect to media queries.

                <h1># My Reflections - Sprint Two</h1> 
        <div class="para-1"> 
                <h3>My Blog</h3>
                <h4>### Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms</h4>
                
                This exercise I created a .html file and linked it with the css file. I also learned about the materials that will go into the header file of the .html file. I have understood the steps involved in setting this up. When building the blog webpage, the header is important because it gathers links such as css and helps the browser understand the file we are creating.
                
                <h4>### Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox? </h4>
                Yes
                
                <h3> Learn HTML and CSS </h3>
                
                <h4>### What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones? </h4>
                I chose to watch the video because I didn't want to miss out something.
                
                
                <h4>### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</4>
                Learning to use the command line to navigate to another directory and reopening it in text editor with your using the mouse. 
                I used my notes/reflection to figure out commands such ass ... and 'code'.
                
                
                <h4>### What are of you proud of from during this challenge?</h4>
                I am proud of that I am actually learning to use the command line more and realising how easy it is to go through and save changes again through command line
                
                
                <h4>### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</h4>
                May be, but I know there is still some fine tuning to be done.
                
                
                <h4>### How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?</h4>
                Way more faster maybe under five minustes :)
                
                
                
                <h3># Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h4>
                
                <h4>### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  </h4>
                
                HTML is powerful just in itself. It is like a huge grid that holds or place information in smaller grids. The grids can be square or rectangel depending on resolution of the viwport on is using. CSS on the other hand is just as powerful but it allow for the grid to have styling. Think of it as HTML is just a blank piece of paper and css is what makes the paper have style such as color border etc.
                
                
                <h4>### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? </h4>
                No real major obstacle was faced in this challenge. But if I did, I am pretty certain that a small query to the google search would have solved it.
                
                
                <h4>### Any moments of surprise or joy? </h4>
                I was suprised many times but the one I remember is that I don't have to remember everything that should go into a header, as there might be templates out there *cheat sheets.
                
                
               <h4> ### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h4>
                Wow never thought of connecting them to animals. Well HTML could be a whale and CSS could be a bird or paradise. The whale being huge contains can take in a lot of stuff from the sea and the bird of paradise is just full of colors.
